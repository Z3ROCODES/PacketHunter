## Features

- **Packet Sniffer**: Capture and analyze packets in real time from your network.
- **Packet Sender**: Send custom crafted packets to a target IP address.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Get immediate feedback on sent packets and their status.
- **Lightweight**: Minimalistic design with easy-to-use commands for simple deployment.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using PacketHunter, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- `scapy` library installed (for network sniffing and crafting packets)
  ```
  pip install scapy
For the Packet Sniffer, you'll need access to raw network interfaces, so make sure you're running the tool with proper privileges (sudo/admin).

Installation
Clone the repository:




git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PacketHunter.git
cd PacketHunter
Install required Python packages:




pip install -r requirements.txt
If you're using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it before running the scripts.

Usage
1. Packet Sniffer (sniffer.py)
Use the packet sniffer to capture network traffic:




python sniffer.py
The sniffer will capture all packets on your network interface, print the summary to the console, and allow you to analyze the network traffic.

2. Packet Sender (sender.py)
Use the packet sender to send crafted packets to a target:




python sender.py
You'll be prompted to enter the target IP address, and the tool will begin sending packets every second.

Example
Packet Sniffer:




$ python sniffer.py
Packet captured: <Packet Info>
...
Packet Sender:




$ python sender.py
Enter target IP: 192.168.1.100
Packet sent to 192.168.1.100
